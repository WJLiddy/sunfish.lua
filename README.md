Sunfish.lua
===========

Need a tiny lua chess engine for your game? Preferably one that's fast and easy to understand at the expense of smart? 
Here's my take on Sunfish.Lua, which makes it super easy to `require` and chess away.

Features all the goodness from https://github.com/soumith/sunfish.lua plus optimizations and restructuring to make it easy to use.

(I ain't sayin it's a 1600 rated player, but it ain't gonna hang a piece on move 6)
